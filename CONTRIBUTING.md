# Contributing

## Take Your First Steps

- Try going through the project requiremnts and the code. See wiki and milestones etc.
- Run it in your local and login using below credentials.

      Tenant: tn01
      Username: interopUser
      Password: 12345678
- Don't change above login credentials create your own by visiting into Admin/Users
- Join the [discord](https://gitter.im/openMF/digital-bank-ui) for this project.
- Try understanding the project code, we are using rxjs and ngrx store, which might be a new thing for you.
- Go through the code and start finding bugs, there are tons of bugs currently. Make issues for those bugs and raise pr, like smaller css issues, or code refactoring. We need a lot of refactoring, go through angular best practices and see what code can be refactored.
- Then maybe work on some functionality issues.
- You don't have to make a lot of pr's, just focus on quality of pr's.
- Create a [taiko](https://github.com/getgauge/taiko) test to consolidate your pr's

This project will require a few days for getting used to, and understanding what's happening.
Also, you don't have to run fineract CN in your local, we are using a hosted instance of fineract CN, which has a few microservices hosted at buffalo.mifos URL. Check out https://github.com/openMF/digital-bank-ui/blob/master/proxy.conf.json

Also take time to learn about [rxjs](https://angular.io/guide/rx-library), [ngrx](https://ngrx.io/docs) store and [redux](https://redux.js.org/introduction/getting-started) store in general, and also what we are trying to do in this project. Play around with the UI a bit on your machine.

### Understand the basics

Not sure what a pull request is, or how to submit one? Take a look at GitHub's excellent [help
documentation](https://help.github.com/articles/using-pull-requests/) first.

### Search Issues or; create an issue if necessary

### Discuss non-trivial contribution ideas with committers

## Create a Branch

### Branch from `master`

Master currently represents current work progress. Please submit all pull requests there, even bug fixes and minor improvements. We might have a `develop` branch going forward for new pr's.

Also this project is in nascent stages, you can make the issue templates, pr templates, readme etc better, other similar things.
